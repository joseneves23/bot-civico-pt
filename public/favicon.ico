The favicon.ico file is a binary file that typically contains an image. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as favicon.ico in the specified directory.

You can create a simple favicon using an online favicon generator or design your own using an image editing tool. Once you have the image, save it as `favicon.ico` in the `/bot-civico/bot-civico/public/` directory.
